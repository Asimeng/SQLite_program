# SQLite_program

<p>
  This is a simple Python program that creates a SQLite database and records the names and timestamps of videos and pictures of a folder into the database. 
  The program then deletes the files in the folder after it records them into the database.
  
  <em>I  wrote this program as part of my internship with Soldersmith intelligence (https://soldersmith.com/)</em>
